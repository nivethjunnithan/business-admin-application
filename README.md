<b> - Spring Backend</b>

Spring Boot Web Java backend application that exposes a REST API to
manage hobbies. Its secured endpoints can just be accessed if an access
token (JWT) is provided.

spring-backend stores its data in a MySql database.

spring-backend has the following endpoints

<b>- React Frontend</b>

ReactJS frontend application where users can find and save hobbies and businesses can manage offers. In order to access the application, user / business must login using his/her username and password. All the requests coming from react-frontend to secured endpoints in spring-backend have a access token (JWT) that is generated when user / business logs in.

react-frontend uses Semantic UI React as CSS-styled framework.
